.SH Limit Section Structure
.BR
.PP
.PP
Each limit definition begins with the line Begin Limit and ends with
the line End Limit. A limit section is defined in horizontal format.
Each row defines one consumer or resource. At least one consumer and
one resouce must be specified in a limit section.

.SS Description
.BR
.PP
.PP
A space-separated list of queue names on which limits are enforced.
.PP
The list must contain valid queue names defined in \fBlsb.queues\fR.
.PP
Use the not operator (~) to exclude queues from the all specification in the limit. 
This is useful if you have a large number of queues but only want to exclude 
a few queues from the limit definition.

.SS Description
.BR
.PP
.PP
A space-separated list of user names or user groups on which limits are enforced.
.PP
User names must be valid login names.
User group names can be OpenLava user groups or UNIX user groups.
UNIX user groups must be configured in \fBlsb.users\fR.
.PP
If a group contains a subgroup, the limit also applies
to each member in the subgroup recursively.
.PP
Use the not operator (~) to exclude users or user groups from the all specification in the limit.
This is useful if you have a large number of users but only want to exclude 
a few users or groups from the limit definition.

.PP
A space-separated list of host names or host groups 
defined in \fBlsb.hosts\fR on which limits are enforced.
.PP
If a group contains a subgroup, the limit also applies
