Task uploading is done by external python script!
Batch account, job name are hardcoded in the python script.

#cpus is hardcoded to be 999.
To put it into effect, openlava service on head node should be restarted.



TODO:
Make the python script part of the autotools project.

Create a config file in which:
    python script reads keys, batch accounts;
    LIM reads #cpus.
