Release Notes for openlava version 2.2.

2.2 is a bug fix release.

HIGHLIGHTS
----------
-- When migrant hosts are added or removed, we must increment or
   decrement the numHosts field in the struct clusterNode (myClusterPtr)
   to allow the periodic master announcement to be sent to dynamic
   nodes in the cluster on master lim restart.
-- Don't call select in rd_select_() when the input file descriptor
   is less than zero, as this causes a buffer overflow abort when
   openlava is built with fortify for debian packages.
-- Fix core dump in bjobs. Since 2.1 hostid start from 0.
-- Fixed a typo in the lsf.cluster man page.
-- Print correct pending reason when hostid is 0.
-- Corrected HACKING file.
-- make install no longer installs the configuration file, this avoids
   overwriting production configuration files.
