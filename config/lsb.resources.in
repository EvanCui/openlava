# Resource limit profile. This file is optional.
# This file affects the scheduling behavior of the openlava Batch system on submitted jobs.

# The resource limit sets limits for the maximum amount of the specified resources
# that must be available for jobs to start, and which resource consumers the limits apply to.
# Limits are enforced during job resource allocation.

# The bresources command displays view of limits configured in Limit section and
# current usage of resource allocation limits.

# Limit section enclosed by Begin Limit and End Limit.
# A limit section is defined in vertical format.
# Each row defines one consumer or resource.

# Consumer types:
# USERS - A space-separated list of user names or user groups defined in lsb.users on which limits are enforced.
# QUEUES - A space-separated list of queue names on which limits are enforced.
# HOSTS - A space-separated list of hosts, host groups defined in lsb.hosts on which limits are enforced.
# PROJECTS - A space-separated list of project names on which limits are enforced.

# Resource types:
# JOBS - Maximum number of running or suspended (RUN, SSUSP, USUSP) jobs available to resource consumers.
# SLOTS - Maximum number of job slots available to resource consumers.

# Syntax:
# USERS=all [~]user_name ... | all [~]user_group ...
# QUEUE=all [~]queue_name ..
# HOSTS=all [~]host_name ... | all [~]host_group ...
# PROJECTS=all [~]project_name ...
# JOBS=integer
# SLOTS=integer


# Example 1: disallow non-member projects to use a particular queue
#Begin Limit
#NAME=limit1
#PROJECTS=all ~p1 ~p2 ~p3
#QUEUES=priority idle
#SLOTS=0
#End Limit

# Example 2: limit number of jobs per project
#Begin Limit
#NAME=limit2
#PROJECTS=p1 p2
#QUEUES=all ~idle
#JOBS=20
#End Limit

# Example 3: only allow certain users to use a hostgroup
#Begin Limit
#NAME=limit3
#USERS=all ~david ~wlu
#HOSTS=group0
#SLOTS=0
#End Limit

# Example 4: specify which projects are allowed to use certain hostgroups from a certain queue 
#Begin Limit
#NAME=limit4
#PROJECTS=all ~p1 ~p2
#HOSTS=host0 host1
#QUEUES=priority
#SLOTS=0
#End Limit
